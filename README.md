<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Here is some examples of the functionality within the site:

### Logging in
Users will be able to log in with a previous account (if signed up in the past) or sign up and create a brand new account
![M Rendezvous U][log-in]

### Groups/Events Pages

Once logged in, users will be able to navigate through the events and groups pages to see the different groups and activities to offer.
![M Rendezvous U][groups-page]
![M Rendezvous U][events-page]

### Creating a Group and an Event (once group is created)

Once a user is ready to create a group, clicking on ***Start a new group!*** at the top of the page will take you to a form. Once the form is complete and every input field is valid, it will allow you to submit and create your own group.

Once your group is created you will be navigated to the page to view/edit details as you like. You will also be allowed access to create an event once your group is created.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Here are a few features that I look forward to implementing in the near future.

-  Memberships - Users will soon be able to see the members apart of the group and owners of those groups will be able to add, edit, and delete memberships from groups.
- AWS for Images - Users will be able to upload images straight from their device as oppsed to having to input an URL
